X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) is an essentially non-destructive imaging method to gain insight into a multitude of objects.
At the Institute of Anatomy we run three micro-CT machines which allow us to scan (mostly) biomedical samples over a very large scale of sizes (sub-mm to nearly half a meter) and resolutions.
The talk will present different studies performed with collaborators from several faculties of the University of Bern to give an insight into the imaging questions we can answer and details we can query from a diverse kind of samples.
