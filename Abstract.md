X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) is a non-destructive imaging method to gain insight into a multitude of objects.
At the Institute of Anatomy we run two micro-CT machines as well as one multiscale nano-CT system, which permit us to scan (mostly) biomedical samples over a very large scale of sizes (from sub-mm to nearly half a meter) and resolutions.
The talk will present various studies with collaborators from several faculties of the University of Bern to give an insight into our imaging capabilities.
The audience will get an idea of the questions we can answer and details we can query from a diverse kind of samples.
