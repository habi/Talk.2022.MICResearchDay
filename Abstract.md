X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) is an essentially non-destructive imaging method to gain insight into a multitude of objects.
At the Institute of Anatomy we run three micro-CT machines which permit us to scan (mostly) biomedical samples over a very large scale of sizes (sub-mm to nearly half a meter) and resolutions.
The talk will present different studies performed with collaborators from several faculties to give an insight into the possible imaging questions we can help to answer.
